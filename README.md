## Using Another Template

When you ran `npx create-remix@latest` there were a few choices for hosting. You can run that again to create a new project, then copy over relevant code/assets from your current app to the new project that's pre-configured for your target server.

Most importantly, this means everything in the `app/` directory, but if you've further customized your current application outside of there it may also include:

- Any assets you've added/updated in `public/`
- Any updated versions of root files such as `.eslintrc.js`, etc.

```sh
cd ..
# create a new project, and pick a pre-configured host
npx create-remix@latest
cd my-new-remix-app
# remove the new project's app (not the old one!)
rm -rf app
# copy your app over
cp -R ../my-old-remix-app/app app
```

## Deployment

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
